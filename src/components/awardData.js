    text: "I am really enjoying his course, Logic 1. Unique editing of lecture videos shows us our lecturer's funny personality, which makes all pre-recorded lectures far more enjoyable. (I usually find it difficult to concentrate to watch pre-recorded lectures.) Not only do we learn new things every week, but I enjoyed watching those lectures. Also, the course's learn page was also fun to explore. I was not that interested in the subject much at the beginning, but just exploring the course learn page was really exciting. Not only academic materials, but we can also even find our lecturer's Vegan peanut butter cookie recipe, or a Spotify playlist for our courses. At the beginning of the semester, we had a short trailer video (like a film) for this course. The engagement of making the learn page more fun helped me to be a little more interested in the subject.",

Brian is one of the first lecturers I've came across who wholeheartedly cares about his students, his course, and his subject. He has made semester two a lot more bearable for me, in a storm full of essays and deadlines and research projects, Brian is the warm logical shelter that takes me in and keeps me sane.",

They are very different from my other lectures but this has made them exciting to watch, allowing me to maintain interest/concentration for longer, and gave me an idea of what a normal year without online learning would be like. The Elogic application has been a great way to practise working with the formal languages and the homework has been challenging but hasn't taken up a disproportionate amount of my time. After taking mostly essay subjects so far, I was unsure of this course at first, but Brian's teaching style has made it a really good experience.",

There's so much activity that makes the course seem so much more alive than expetced from a course being taught in the midst of a pandemic. The efforts put in by Dr. Brian are truly commendable and I definitely would recommend this course! Excellent lecture quality although it was just recorded lectures from last year. But the sort of animations added in to make it a little less monotonous, the accessibility of the course website (firstly, the course has it's own brilliant website?!?!?) and just the support received through discussion boards, tutorials, etc. are definitely worth a lot more recognition!",

Since the pandemic has begun, there has been a constant air of anxiety, uncertainty and well, just plain boredom. However, when watching Brian's beautifully edited videos, this all goes away. I suddenly forget that I am locked inside my own room that I haven't left for the past three days and I am transported to a lively lecture hall, where I should've been in this year. There stands a happy lecturer, cracking jokes and who actually looks like he enjoys doing his job, delivering me characterful and funny, yet informative lectures on logic. In fact, I enjoy Brian's videos so much, that I have started to just watch them in my downtime, relishing what 'normal' used to look like. It is clear that Brian puts a lot of effort into his craft, with his informative content and what I assume, hours-worth of editing. His lectures are like no other, and I cannot express how much I appreciate him being my lecturer, even though he doesn't know me. His efforts and passions are definitely not wasted, and they have encouraged me to work very hard on logic!",

    text: "Dr. Rabern has managed to create the only engaging online lectures I've viewed all year. He uses recordings of last years lectures (which on it's own is more engaging than a lecturer alone in their office, watching the lecturer play off a crowd is very engaging), but he doesn't leave them as is, he takes the time to edit them in order to make them even more entertaining. For instance, adding audio effects, etc. In one lecture he edited something he said into a 30 sec music video. He essentially creates memes in the middle of lectures, meaning there is a built in brain break, and one that wouldn't be possible to achieve in a normal lecture hall. It is so hard to focus on a powerpoint and a lecturer talking alone for 40 mins. However, Dr. Rabern creates lectures that are genuinely entertaining, meaning we the students are able to better maintain focus on the educational content we're supposed to be absorbing. Their engaging nature ultimately makes them more informative. Not only that, but the homework is very conveniently completed online, and is more informative because of the online platform it is completed on, given a computer can tell you when you are wrong and a piece of paper can't. Dr. Rabern has taken the current circumstances in stride and created a class that doesn't suffer from the online format, but takes advantage of it and really delivers a quality curriculum.",

Little details like a vegan peanut butter cookie recipe and a Logic 1 spotify playlist really help dissolve the barrier between lecturer and student created by the online teaching experience. The lectures provided by Dr Rabern are edited in such a way that I look forward to watching them. They always have fun videos and effects added to them which greatly improves the learning experience. Having interesting things going on in the lectures paired with the closer than normal relationship between student and lecturer (created by Dr Rabern's entire teaching method) really make this course very enjoyable and undoubtedly improve the quality of the entire course. Dr Rabern has definitely risen to the challenge of having to teach solely online and it is no wonder that his name shot straight to mind when considering who to nominate for an award.",

His lectures were very interesting, interactive and fun, everything was easy to find on Learn and the homework was on a digital platform which was automatically marked and so easy to use. He made me love logic and I know that I want to take another module in it. Furthermore, there was a vast array of support if needed, including a logic lab which I used multiple times where tutors would help and every time I consolidated my understanding. The course organisation and the effort he put in did not go unnoticed!",
