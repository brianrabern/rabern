      "A memory of Landon I will never forget involved his remarkable mind and his endless determination. Upon beating him in chess, Landon immediately declared that he could build a chess program that could beat me. I told him I didn't think he could do it. He went on to build that program from scratch and teach it to look ahead several moves, teaching it common opening strategies, etc. That chess program did end up defeating me. One of the most amazing things about it was he did this while he was still in high school, back in the late '90s.",

      "Our collaboration was highly productive and I will always cherish it for everything that Landon taught me, both about math (particularly, graph theory) and about how to conduct research. My confidence and skills grew tremendously during our peak time of collaboration, and I will always be grateful for having known and worked with him.",

      "Landon was willing to collaborate and talk with anyone who was interested in higher life purpose. Like Erdős, the mathematician he admired so much (and was proud of his Erdős Number of 2!), who always had a math problem to challenge his mentees with, Landon always had a book recommendation for people he was talking to based on their interests, and often gave them his personal copy or sent it to them right away.",

      "I have two memories of Landon; the first is me finally (luckily) beating him at chess in 5th grade at Winchester Elementary, knowing that he was WAY better than me at that game and someone I regarded as extremely intelligent. The second was in high school when I observed his (far superior) programming abilities and that convinced me to pursue careers outside software engineering. I remember him as one of the smartest people from my early childhood.",

      "He was perhaps the epitome of a different thinker. I only needed to point Landon at a problem and he'd quickly understand it, and then quickly find novel things to do in the space---and he found a few interesting things to do on his own, too. We had a request to do something in quantum computing (although none of us in research knew anything about it), and in a few weeks Landon had not only learned the literature, but was implementing novel quantum applications. Along the way, he also started work on explaining AI systems, something that will benefit our customer, though I'm not sure who I can get do it without Landon. He was extremely bright, but nevertheless was a genuinely good person. Many smart people treat their intelligence as if it endows them with special powers to ignore or demean others, but Landon was always down-to-earth, eager to help, and humble. A genuine nice guy. I will miss him greatly.",

      "Landon and I were in the same math class our Junior year of high school in Roseburg, Oregon. Landon was quiet at first but as I got to know him he was incredibly funny and full of wit. I was struck by his profound intelligence and had troubling understanding how we were in the same class. That was the year I learned the quadratic formula, which I would have long sense forgot if not for him (I majored in English in college, leaving math behind). Landon programmed my TI-86 graphing calculator with a program that could solve the quadratic formula by inputting the values for a, b and c. It was brilliant, it worked every time, and I was truly astounded. So much so, I've never forgotten him, that class, or that calculator.",

      "Landon would greet me at the office door asking 'What have you got for me?' This was how he initiated an immediate mathematics collaboration. He said it with a twinkle in his eye, and I delighted in the conversations that followed. Landon had a way of latching on to the most wide-reaching ideas. It seemed like he was looking for some kind of miraculous, universal theorem. We called it The All Things Theorem. This theorem was a myth, but it represented Landon's approach very well. If there were such a theorem, he was on a mission to find it. Earlier this year, Landon and I took a long walk through San Francisco. It had been many years since grad school, so we had a lot of catching up to do. He told me about his meditation, his artificial intelligence research, and the journey of introspection that naturally came along with those pursuits. His new goal was to understand intelligence itself. In a sense, I think he was still on the same mission he had always been: to find that big idea that would shed light on all the small ones. As he was headed home that day, Landon explained that he used ride-sharing apps to get everywhere. This was sometimes expensive, but it freed him from the tedium of memorizing maps. As long as he had his phone, he could get where he needed to go and meditate during the ride. This is how I choose to remember him: a person who cleared his mind of mundane details to make room for the eternal endeavor to understand all things. He was a remarkable person, a dear friend, and I will miss him terribly.",

      "I knew Landon only a few months but had come to like him very much. We had many excellent conversations ranging from computational theories of mind to metaphysics of consciousness. Our formal research focus was human learning and conceptual semantics. He was clearly driven by deep existential questions. I'm sad that I didn't get more time to get to know him.",

      "A memory I have is of us playing with his electric cars, which most had been taken apart to add bigger batteries or an extra motor for something. There was one time we gutted one of my plastic boats, strapped a small rocket engine to it, and sent it skipping across the water. I remember our clubhouse code phrase was “grass grows greener over the septic tank”. To this day, I know Pi to the tenth digit because Landon went through a phase one summer where he repeated it constantly to me. My oldest son's name is Landon. After he was born we were undecided on a name. As I thought of names, I would think of someone I knew with that name and decide against it just because of the way that person turned out or acts. When the name 'Landon' popped into my head, I immediately thought of my childhood friend Landon Rabern and knew that was going to be my son's name.",

      "landon taught me that love could be kind and uplifting again; he showed me what it truly felt like to be seen, in a way i never realized i hadn't been before, for all of me. he always encouraged, often demanded, me to be even more open, compassionate than i already thought i was, to meditate, to push my boundaries in every way possible, to always be learning and growing. all he wanted was to be accepted as he was, feel safe, be loved, and to love. he changed me forever, made me look at people, humanity, much more deeply, and redouble my efforts to create a better world. he made me a better mom, a better human every day. he was a gift most of us didn't know how to fully appreciate while we had him. i imagine he's up there levitating in the clouds, smiling from all his cells inside out, one of his favorite meditations. i miss him, and those piercing blue eyes that saw everything, his love for his boys, and will remember him in every forest, cold beach, anytime i see eggnog, heavy cream, tillamook cheese, or umpqua dairy chocolate milk, a game of chess or Set, philosophy or math books, and so many more moments. I know i will see him in another life to come.",

      "I lived with Landon during his first year of graduate school at UCSB. I met him in person for the first time when I picked him up at the Santa Barbara airport. He playfully mocked me for a while for hesitantly shaking his hand. He felt like a best friend right away. I bet everyone who knew Landon felt that way too. He was very special. Of course he was the smartest person I've ever met. We played chess together frequently and of course I rarely won or even came close. Betsy was even harder. I also remember playing a computer game he and his brother had made as kids. We would talk for hours every night about everything, mostly math and physics and computing and chess and religion and girls and philosophy. There was never a boring conversation. We raced each other at solving Rubik's cubes. This was the only competition we had that was close (perhaps also a game we invented that I think we called Reiben-Ball that involved throwing hackysacks at a bookshelf). He made me coffee every morning, I'm still addicted. He would wake me up by playing Radiohead (Kid A). His favorite book was Notes from Underground. He prided himself on eating for about $2 a day: a box of pasta and a can of tomatoes. He would do 200 pushups daily. Although he was a vegetarian, he liked to eat burnt pepperoni off a pizza. We went to a transcendental meditation class and discussed becoming Buddhists. I wish I remembered more. We grew apart when he moved away, although I always assumed we would reconnect at some point and I was looking forward to it. He had reached out a couple times over the last year but I didn't respond because I was thinking up an impressive reply and never completed it. I will always have that regret. I wish I had more time with him, he will be missed.",

      "I remember the first time I met him at Wash U.... Wash U has these fellowships that they give to the top 1 or 2 people that apply each year in different categories, and Landon was 'the guy who won the math fellowship' in the engineering school and I was 'the guy who won the math fellowship' in the arts and sciences school, so of course my group of friends (who are drunk) start heckling his group of friends (who are also drunk) and they are heckling back and somehow the two groups get to the point where they are scheduling some kind of chess match to see who was the biggest nerd at Wash U (or something like that) and I just remember hearing this voice coming from his room, yelling out to his friends, 'No, you idiots, you can't judge a person's intelligence by how well they play chess!  You judge them by how well thier CHESS BOT PLAYS CHESS!'  And then there was this big drunken cheer which I (who at the time could barely program 'Hello world') took as my cue to go home.",
